	<p>Canada is a very diverse country. From our multiculturalism, to our vast environments throughout the country, Canada is incredibly beautiful. Because of the increased immigrants coming into Canada, it has been very noticeable that our diversity of food has also become larger. Canada is actually the second largest country with 9.98 million square miles, following Russia. Due to Canada's size, Canada also has the longest internation border.</p><br>
